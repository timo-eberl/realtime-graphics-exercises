<h3 id="crown-mesh-generation">Crown Mesh Generation</h3>
<p><img src="images/mesh-combined.png" /></p>
<p>The crown mesh consists of multiple parts (from left to right): A
curved torus at the top, two torus shapes and a thin flat part. The top
part of the mesh is bent slightly outward.</p>
<p>The bent torus follows a Bézier curve defined with the
<code>Path2D</code> Node in Godot:</p>
<p><img src="images/curve2d.png" /></p>
<p>The number of tips is configurable as well as the height and the
subdivision detail of the mesh.</p>
<p>A crown with reduced subdivision detail and 2 tips:</p>
<p><img src="images/mesh-low-detail-2-tips.png" /></p>
<h3 id="gem-mesh-generation">Gem Mesh Generation</h3>
<p>An algorithm was implemented that can generate different kinds of
gems with different parameters. Three gem were created using this
algorithm. They have been scaled using the <code>Node3D</code>s
transform.</p>
<p><img src="images/gems.png" /></p>
<p>The script <code>mesh_generation.gd</code> contains the code for the
mesh generation of both the gem and the individual crown parts.</p>
<h3 id="gem-placement">Gem Placement</h3>
<p><img src="images/mesh-with-gems.png" /></p>
<p>The script <code>crown.gd</code> contains the functions
<code>spawn_gems_top</code>, <code>spawn_gems_middle</code>,
<code>spawn_gems_bottom</code>, which place the gems.</p>
<h3 id="metal-material">Metal Material</h3>
<p><img src="images/gold-material.png" /></p>
<p>A gold material was created by setting according albedo, metallic and
roughness values.</p>
<h3 id="corroded-metal">Corroded Metal</h3>
<p><img src="images/gold-corroded.png" /></p>
<p>The corroded version of the gold material adds normal detail as well
as oxidization.</p>
<h3 id="gem-material">Gem Material</h3>
<p><img src="images/gem-material.gif" /></p>
<p>The shader for the gem fakes details of a gem by doing a refraction
along the surface normal. The shader then imitates an infinite plane
that lies inside the diamond, which is parallel to the currently viewed
surface. A cellular noise texture is mapped onto that plane and used to
adjust the color and normal of each cell differently.</p>
<p>Additionally a second material is used using the
<code>next_pass</code> feature of Godot to render the specular
highlights of the actual mesh on top of the “inside” of the gem.</p>
<p>The material is configured to imitate an emerald.</p>
<h3 id="corroded-gem">Corroded Gem</h3>
<p><img src="images/gem-corroded.png" /></p>
<p>The corroded version of the gem adds normal detail, changes the
roughness and adds dirt.</p>
<h3 id="aging-process">Aging Process</h3>
<p><img src="images/age-blend.gif" /></p>
<p>The corroded versions can be blended to the initial version to
simulate the aging process.</p>
<h3 id="complete-interactive-scene">Complete interactive Scene</h3>
<p>A scene was created to showcase the meshes and materials:</p>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://polyhaven.com/a/sepulchral_chapel_basement">HDRI
from Polyhaven</a> is used as background.</li>
<li>Bloom is enabled.</li>
<li>The crown was placed on a red pillow.</li>
<li>A spotlight rotates around the crown and illuminates it.</li>
<li>A weak directional light shines from the top.</li>
<li>Both lights cast shadows using Godots shadow mapping
capabilities.</li>
<li>A <code>ReflectionProbe</code> is placed in the center of the crown
to approximate reflections.</li>
<li>UI elements are available to change the speed of the spotlight, the
age of the crown and the number of tips on the crown.</li>
<li>The camera can be controlled using the mouse.</li>
</ul>
